With over 1.2 million inhabitants, Dublin contains over a quarter of Ireland’s population. However, with most of the population living in the suburbs, Dublin’s city center is relatively small and easy to navigate by foot. Dublin offers many theaters, museums, and galleries, and is famous for its literary tradition and renowned for its theatrical life. Another attractive feature of the city is the presence of live music in every possible venue from the street to formal halls and of course in pubs.",
