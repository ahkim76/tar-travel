test commit from Owen!!!

To run in VSCode, in terminal write
npm install
^ this should install create-react-app

Then write
npm install react react-dom leaflet

Then write 
npm install react-leaflet

Might also need
npm install react-icons

After Leaflet is installed, write
npm run start
and there should be a link
