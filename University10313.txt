The University of Auckland (also known as UoA) was established in 1883, and with over 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students, it is the largest university in New Zealand. It is also consistently ranked the highest universities globally. The University is made up of eight faculties spread over six campuses, with the City campus being the largest and where study abroad students from UNC will spend most of their time.

Location

Auckland, New Zealand
Auckland is located on the North Island of New Zealand.  With a population over one million, it is the largest and most populous urban area in the country; and with most major international corporations having an Auckland office, it is considered the economic capital of New Zealand. What’s more, Auckland consistently ranks high amongst the world’s most livable cities.  

Student Experience
Even before orientation starts at UoA, the Waipapa Noho Marae program gives you the opportunity to spend a night at the center of Māori life at the University, the Waipapa Marae, learn more about the indigenous Māori people and connect with your fellow exchange students. This night of cultural immersion will include a pōwhiri (welcoming ceremony), learning some phrases in te reo Māori (Māori language), singing waiata (songs), and performing poi and haka (performing arts).
